Given an array of nums (integers), return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums.
if there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value. 
(leetcode 2239)


so for example:
if nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]

the output should be 1

since its closest to 0

if nums = [-1,1]
the output should be 1 since it should return the largest between the 2.

if nums = [-4,5]
the output should be -4.


--------

lets break it down:

MOST IMPORTANT - we need to check the closest to 0, -3 and 3 close to 0 the same, so we should concider all nums as positive ! 

we store the last closest so we can compare it in each itteration.

we should itterate over all numbers, since each can be closest to 0.

after itterate we should find the mirror of the closest, so if there is -3 and 3 we should return 3.
 
finally we can return the value of the largest if it mirrored to the closest or return the closest.

cheatsheet -

    Math.abs: 
        Math.abs(-1) === 1        //return the absolute value of an integer, so if its negative it become positive

bonus tip


there is faster solution but its less readable in my prespective:

nums.reduce((acc,num) => {
    if(Math.abs(num) < Math.abs(acc)) {
        return num;
    } else if(Math.abs(num) === Math.abs(acc)){
        return Math.max(num,acc);
    } else {
        return acc;
    }
});
