242 Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an 
anagram
 of s, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false


---

anagram is valid only if 2 strings have the same letters, no matter the order,
so basically the fastest way approach is to use counter set, the char and the amount of appearances, 
if the strings does not contain the same amount of chars return false
