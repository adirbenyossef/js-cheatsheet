383. Ransom Note

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.


Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true
 

lets break it down -
ransomNote should be constructed by magazine, each char in ransomNote should appear in magazine, if not return false, 
if the char appear in magazine but only once and in ransomNote twice return false.

so its pretty simple, we need first to create array of chars from magazine, using magazine.split('');
then we can simply iterate over the ransomNote chars and check if the index of a letter exist, by indexOf() method, 
if the indexOf char is -1 -> return false, since this char missing in the magazine.
if we have the char, set the founded index to be null -> so it return false for next iteration or find the next index.
after going over everything (did not exit before) return true.
