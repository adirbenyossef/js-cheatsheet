1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


----
we need to find the position of 2 numbers that when we add them we get the target value.

so lets think of it as a map of position by the number, since there is only one solution in the array, its pretty easy

we iterate over the nums, if there is diff in map return the map[diff] and current index

populate the map for next iteration.
