1189. Maximum Number of Balloons

Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.

You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

 

Example 1:
Input: text = "nlaebolko"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
Output: 2

Input: text = "leetcode"
Output: 0


we need here check in a string if there is other string, pretty simple for one, but when you need to find 100, its become difficult,
another thing need to take in mind is that this text contain double O and double L.

so basically what need to do here is to sum all the numbers of the letters,
for example: { b: 3, a: 3, l: 6, o: 6, n: 2 };

lowestDivided = the lowest value of divided L or O
check if there lowest or equal in 'b', 'a' or 'n' 

and return the lowest between them.
